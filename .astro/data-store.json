How about the full path?\n\nI was so happy to learn `Svelte`. It comes with a amazing tutorial and `REPL` that facilitates the learning experience. After a few days of getting into Svelte/kit, I was puzzled by the other side of the business. That is the backend or the server side.\n\nTo be clear, it wasn't that I didn't know there exists a entire parallel universe of the web. After all, APIs, databases, and all kinds of server-side stuffs are very well known in the industry. But, the thing that made me extremely confusing was all these frontend guys trying to sneak into the backend.\n\nFor example, when I studied Sveltekit, it got me very confused when seeing e.g., \u003Ci>\"Sveltekit is a full-stack framework\"\u003C/i>. Then, there came a whole bunch of other stuffs that could easily drive anyone crazy. To name a few, `Next.JS` for React.JS, `Nuxt.JS` for Vue.JS, and `Sveltekit` for Svelte.\n\nOn top of that, there are so many tools, for bundling, e.g., `Vite.JS`, database, e.g., `Supabase`, hosting, e.g., `Vercel`, and many more. Then, we have our usual suspects, the champions in the dedicated backend framework world, e.g., `Django` for Python, `Express.JS` for JavaScript, etc.\n\nBack to the topic of \u003Ci>\"Sveltekit is a full-stack framework\"\u003C/i>. For the sake of simplicity, I treated `Next`, `Nuxt`, and `Sveltekit` as `pseudo backend frameworks`, as I realized they mostly try to make the process of building UI/UX intensive apps and the experience of using the app smooth. These full-stack frameworks handles `server-side rendering`, `routing`, and many other things, which were traditionally handled by the dedicated backend frameworks.\n\nThese frameworks are also deeply engaged with the design of the app, such as `Single-Page Application`, `Multi-Page Application`, `Progressive Web Application`, and so on.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 10px; display: flex; align-items: left;\"> \n    \u003Cspan style=\"margin-right: 10px;\">🤔\u003C/span> \n    \u003Cspan>I love SPA in general, browsing the \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular\u003C/a> website is quite like using a native app on my cell. But, there is a downside of it.

I also used Svelte REPL a lot to try out new ideas, see components others created, and share my comments with others.  \n    \u003C/span> \n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cbr>\n\n## Server Side\n\n\u003Cbr>\n\nWhile I was still learning Svelte and its full-stack buddy, I started exploring the backend universe. By backend, I refer to the server-side business, with APIs, databases, and all that. It was very important to me as, for example, I needed to be able to embed my awesome algorithms in my app, and I needed to be able to deploy my app so people can use it.\n\n> \"It is a lot of stuffs going on.\" I questioned why I signed up for the course of the journey.\n\nNot every app requires a dedicated backend. A lot of apps can be engineered with a combo of e.g., svelte + selltkit. However, if I want to build compute/memory-bound stuffs, like ML/AI models/algorithms, I need to build a solid backend. Even just to store the data without crashing the client, a backend is a must.\n\nThe backend was a puzzle, with the pieces all over the place. Among all the pieces, I personally think `Authentication` and `Authorization` are the hardest ones. As a matter of fact, as a beginner, to distinguish between these two guys was already a tough task. Fortunately, a lot of service providers, even some of the backend frameworks, have `Auth` built-in, so I wasn't worrying about how to create them from scratch. But, understanding how they work and how to use them is still very important and ... not easy.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 10px; display: flex; align-items: left;\"> \n    \u003Cspan style=\"margin-right: 10px;\">🤔\u003C/span> \n    \u003Cspan>The best resource I could find for Auth is a Youtube video featuring the talk by \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=996OiexHze0&t=2421s\">Nate Barbettini\u003C/a>. \n    \u003C/span> \n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cbr>\n\nAnother hard piece is database. I had been mainly using `PostgreSQL` at work for many years, but I wasn't a database expert in backend. I knew SQL and can even create a very complex function with `PostgreSQL`. But, the database in backend universe is way more complex than my practice.\n\nFor the database, I like `Supabase`. It uses `PostgreSQL` as its database with all kinds of features, including `vector db` through postgres `pg_vector`, which is an essential feature for developing any AI related apps. I am also using its hosting platform (free tier obviously), so I get to use its built-in authentication and other cool features like `storage`. I use Python for backend, right? So, for manipulating data through database, I use both SQL and `ORM`, where my favorite ORM is `SQLModel`.\n\nAn very important decision to make is to pick my language for backend. It would be nice to use one universal language for both sides of business, and that is the god blessed JavaScript. While I had no problem of using that, I personally felt more confident in using Python for the backend. Indeed, it is not just about confidence. Python is a native data-science/machine learning language, but there wasn't much good support for JavaScript. \u003Ci style=\"opacity: 0.6\">There wasn't even a `numpy` equivalent for JavaScript. JavaScript's asynchronousness comes from its nature, but Python isn't that bad in `async` with, e.g., `asyncio`.\u003C/i>\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 10px; display: flex; align-items: left;\"> \n    \u003Cspan style=\"margin-right: 10px;\">🥳\u003C/span> \n    \u003Cspan>Things are getting changed very rapidly. I have been using both \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index\">Transformers.JS\u003C/a> and \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://js.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction\">LangChain.JS\u003C/a> for both work and personal projects. There is also Tensorflow.JS available, but I am a big fan of PyTorch, and I wish they had JS version as well.\n    \u003C/span> \n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cbr>\n\nThe choice of language for backend is a big decision, as it dictates the tech stack, the way you code, and even the way you think. When it was about the time to choose my backend framework ...\n\nI could actually choose a more comprehensive, full-blown, full-battery framework like `Django`. But, as long as I started studied with `FastAPI`, I felt in love with it. It is really neat and amazingly fast. Its features were neither too much nor too few. It was just about right! The documentation is one of the best I have ever seen for any open-source project. The integration with `Pydantic` and `Uvicorn` makes cooking up an API a pure joy. Overall, it is probably the best Python backend framework with a perfect balance between `developer experience` and `functionality`.\n\nThe learning process of backend wasn't easy. After a couple of weeks, I pretty much finished reading and experimenting every bit of juice I can extract from FastAPI documentations as well as other online resources.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 10px; display: flex; align-items: left;\"> \n    \u003Cspan style=\"margin-right: 10px;\">🤔\u003C/span> \n    \u003Cspan>During that period of time, I realized that, the only way to get everything clear and know how to put pieces together nicely is to invest time on software system design. However, I haven't been able to push much in this battlefield. Along with another plan of learning either \u003Cb>Rust\u003C/b> or \u003Cb>Go\u003C/b> later 2024, I plan to dedicate a few months to bury myself into SD. \n    \u003C/span> \n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cbr>\n\n## Did I make any working stuff?\n\n\u003Cbr>\n\nOnce I felt that I learned enough of HTML, CSS and naive JavaScript, as well as enough of API and database, I committed to my first non-toy project.\n\nFor some reason, my team (at work) lost access to a very nice `vacation planner`, where my peers had been reporting their personal holidays, sick days, and vacation days for many years. It wasn't until I found out many other teams also had same issues that I realized it could be a good opportunity to put my study into serious practice.\n\nI spent a week without doing my usual stuff at work, focusing entirely on making my first `full-stack app`.\nI didn't use `Svelte` as it could only slow me down. I sticked to the naive JavaScript for reactive/dynamice piece, and it turned out just fine. For backend, I used `PostgreSQL` and `FastAPI` to handle user authentication, basic CURD, and some basic API functions.\n\nIt was the following Monday, I posted a short MP4 video of demo in a few slack channels at work before lunch. When I came back from lunch, I was totally surprised there were many people responding to the post and DM me. A lot of teams wanted to use my app! How about that!\n\nIn the end, there was only a few of them willing to make commitment to my vacation planner. The major issue I had was to figure out how to get the app hooked with the company's authentication. It was very complex as I went through the documentations and talked to the dedicated team, and it was clearly beyond my scope.\n\nThe end of the story wasn't very bad. One team signed up for the vacation planner (and my team did too), and they had a experienced backend deverloper who knew all the dirty details of dealing with the company's auth process. \u003Ci>(They actually modified the app a lot so to make it much safer to use at work.

It comes with a amazing tutorial and \u003Ccode>REPL\u003C/code> that facilitates the learning experience.

Then, there came a whole bunch of other stuffs that could easily drive anyone crazy. To name a few, \u003Ccode>Next.JS\u003C/code> for React.JS, \u003Ccode>Nuxt.JS\u003C/code> for Vue.JS, and \u003Ccode>Sveltekit\u003C/code> for Svelte.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On top of that, there are so many tools, for bundling, e.g., \u003Ccode>Vite.JS\u003C/code>, database, e.g., \u003Ccode>Supabase\u003C/code>, hosting, e.g., \u003Ccode>Vercel\u003C/code>, and many more. Then, we have our usual suspects, the champions in the dedicated backend framework world, e.g., \u003Ccode>Django\u003C/code> for Python, \u003Ccode>Express.JS\u003C/code> for JavaScript, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Back to the topic of \u003Ci>“Sveltekit is a full-stack framework”\u003C/i>.

By backend, I refer to the server-side business, with APIs, databases, and all that.

Even just to store the data without crashing the client, a backend is a must.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The backend was a puzzle, with the pieces all over the place. Among all the pieces, I personally think \u003Ccode>Authentication\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>Authorization\u003C/code> are the hardest ones. As a matter of fact, as a beginner, to distinguish between these two guys was already a tough task. Fortunately, a lot of service providers, even some of the backend frameworks, have \u003Ccode>Auth\u003C/code> built-in, so I wasn’t worrying about how to create them from scratch. But, understanding how they work and how to use them is still very important and … not easy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px solid gray; padding: 10px; display: flex; align-items: left;\"> \n    \u003Cspan style=\"margin-right: 10px;\">🤔\u003C/span> \n    \u003Cspan>The best resource I could find for Auth is a Youtube video featuring the talk by \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=996OiexHze0&#x26;t=2421s\">Nate Barbettini\u003C/a>. \n    \u003C/span> \n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cbr>\n\u003Cp>Another hard piece is database. I had been mainly using \u003Ccode>PostgreSQL\u003C/code> at work for many years, but I wasn’t a database expert in backend. I knew SQL and can even create a very complex function with \u003Ccode>PostgreSQL\u003C/code>. But, the database in backend universe is way more complex than my practice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the database, I like \u003Ccode>Supabase\u003C/code>. It uses \u003Ccode>PostgreSQL\u003C/code> as its database with all kinds of features, including \u003Ccode>vector db\u003C/code> through postgres \u003Ccode>pg_vector\u003C/code>, which is an essential feature for developing any AI related apps. I am also using its hosting platform (free tier obviously), so I get to use its built-in authentication and other cool features like \u003Ccode>storage\u003C/code>. I use Python for backend, right? So, for manipulating data through database, I use both SQL and \u003Ccode>ORM\u003C/code>, where my favorite ORM is \u003Ccode>SQLModel\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An very important decision to make is to pick my language for backend. It would be nice to use one universal language for both sides of business, and that is the god blessed JavaScript. While I had no problem of using that, I personally felt more confident in using Python for the backend. Indeed, it is not just about confidence. Python is a native data-science/machine learning language, but there wasn’t much good support for JavaScript. \u003Ci style=\"opacity: 0.6\">There wasn’t even a \u003Ccode>numpy\u003C/code> equivalent for JavaScript.

But, as long as I started studied with \u003Ccode>FastAPI\u003C/code>, I felt in love with it. It is really neat and amazingly fast. Its features were neither too much nor too few. It was just about right! The documentation is one of the best I have ever seen for any open-source project. The integration with \u003Ccode>Pydantic\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>Uvicorn\u003C/code> makes cooking up an API a pure joy. Overall, it is probably the best Python backend framework with a perfect balance between \u003Ccode>developer experience\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>functionality\u003C/code>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The learning process of backend wasn’t easy.
