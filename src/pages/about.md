I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and Computer Scientist who loves designing and building algorithms to solve tough problems. I’m all about taking theoretical concepts and turning them into practical, real-world solutions that drive innovation and efficiency.

My academic background has sharpened my expertise in adaptive and higher-order optimization algorithms for nonlinear and nonconvex problems, but what excites me even more is using algorithms from computer science to tackle real-world challenges.

I see myself as a builder, turning these algorithms into scalable software that makes a real impact.
